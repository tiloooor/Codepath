# Project 3 - *Yelp*

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

 - Getting the autolayout to work and look correct was difficult and at times, annoying.
